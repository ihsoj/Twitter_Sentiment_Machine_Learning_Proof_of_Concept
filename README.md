# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning 

## Project Description:
This project is a full-stack Machine Learning and web scraping proof of concept to retrieve Twitter posts, store data in a MongoDB database, utilize a Machine Learning model to depict happy or sad sentiment by post, and populate a web page. Three Machine Learning models were trained and tested to predict sentiment: (1) Logistic Regression, (2) Natural Language Processing with Naive Bayes Classification, and a (3) Long-Short Term Memory Deep Neural Network. The best model was chosen to categorize new posts based on confusion matrix KPIâ€™s. Data updates are in real-time at the click of a button.



## Data:

## Conclusions:
Both Logistic Regression and the Long-Short Term Deep Neural Network (LSTM) Machine Learning Models outperformed Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Naive Bayes on key confusion matrix KPI's including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
