# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning 
This project is a full-stack Machine Learning and web scraping endeavor to retrieve Twitter posts, store data in a MongoDB database, populate a web page, and utilize a Machine Learning model to depict happy or sad sentiment by post. Three machine learning models were trained and tested to predict sentiment: (1) Logistic Regression, (2) Natural Language Processing, and a (3) Long-Short Term Memory Deep Neural Network to predict sentiment. The best model based on confusion matrix KPIâ€™s was chosen to categorize new posts on the web page. Data updates are in real-time at the click of a button.
